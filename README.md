# jwt-auth-svelte Library

### This is a work in progress.

This library is a library suited for JWT authentication and verification of JWT tokens.

This presumes that you have a backend that is able to generate JWT tokens and that you have a backend that is able to verify JWT tokens.

This library is not a backend library, it is a frontend library, for client side authentication and verification of JWT tokens.
